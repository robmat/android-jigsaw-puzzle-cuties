## Rewards System

Upon completing a puzzle, the image you just solved is added to your personal in-game gallery. You can browse all your unlocked images anytime. To personalize the experience, you can add your own images to the `app/src/main/assets/img` directory. These images will then be available to be used as puzzles and subsequently as rewards in the gallery.

## Cutting Algorithm

The puzzle pieces are dynamically generated using a sophisticated cutting algorithm. The core of this is the `PuzzleCurvesGenerator`, which creates unique, pseudo-random SVG paths for the puzzle edges. This ensures that every puzzle has a distinct set of piece shapes.

The `PuzzleCutter` then uses these SVG paths to slice the source image. It employs a flood fill algorithm to accurately define the bitmap for each individual piece, resulting in a clean and precise cut. This advanced technique guarantees a different cut for every game and realistic look.
